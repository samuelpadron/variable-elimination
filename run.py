Entry point for the creation of the variable elimination algorithm in Python 3.
Code to read in Bayesian Networks has been provided. We assume you have installed the pandas package.

    # The class BayesNet represents a Bayesian network from a .bif file in several variables
    net = BayesNet('earthquake.bif') # Format and other networks can be found on http://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/
    
    # These are the variables read from the network that should be used for variable elimination
    #print("Nodes:")
    #print(net.nodes)
    #print("Values:")
    #print(net.values)
    #print("Parents:")
    #print(net.parents)
    #print("Probabilities:")
    #print(net.probabilities)

    # Make your variable elimination code in the seperate file: 'variable_elim'. 
    # You use this file as follows:
    factors = [net.probabilities[node] for node in net.nodes]
    ve = VariableElimination(net)
    
    #print("Factor product test:")
    #print(ve.factor_product(factors[0], factors[2]))
    
    #print("Factor marginalization test:")
    #print(ve.factor_marginalization(factors[2], factors[0]))
    
    #print("Factor reduction test:")
    #print(ve.factor_reduction(factors[2], "Burglary", "True"))
    
    #ve.factor_reduction(net.probabilities['Alarm'], net.probabilities['Alarm'].columns.values[1])
    print(net.probabilities['Alarm'], "\n")
    ve.factor_reduction(net.probabilities['Alarm'], 'Earthquake', 'True')
    
    
    # Set the node to be queried as follows:
    #query = 'Alarm'

    # The evidence is represented in the following way (can also be empty when there is no evidence): 
    #evidence = {'Burglary': 'True'}

    # Determine your elimination ordering before you call the run function. The elimination ordering   
    # is either specified by a list or a heuristic function that determines the elimination ordering
    # given the network. Experimentation with different heuristics will earn bonus points. The elimination
    # ordering can for example be set as follows:
    #elim_order = net.nodes

    # Call the variable elimination function for the queried node given the evidence and the elimination ordering as follows:   
    #ve.run(query, evidence, elim_order)
